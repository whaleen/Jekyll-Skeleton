Paragraphs are indented. This is common in print and it looks good in Poise due to the horizontally centered nature of the site's design. Without indentations, a sharp vertical line becomes percievable at the left margin of the page. This begins to make the whole page seem unbalanced -- especially when you have long paragraphs.

#### Headings are centered

Moving on, we will have a new paragraph here and in the hopes that it will be lengthy enough to represent the look and feel of a professional blog post author's, we will continue writing without a real purpose other than to fill space with words more carefully than you might with some filler text from a weird generator. This should be enough.

##### Some Other Basics

A link will appear <a href="#">as such</a> and you may ad <em>emphaisis</em> to a word in as <strong>boldly</strong> a manner you like. Ok great. Now what else is indented? Why, lists of course. They sit nicely-in from the left margin.
