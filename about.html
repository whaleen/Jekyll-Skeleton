      <p>This is Prose, a theme created for the static site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. It supports <a href="#">multiple authors</a>. It <a href="#">does not use javascript</a>. It does not use web fonts. Nicely organized CSS partials are compiled and minified with SASS. The HTML is very nice. This very demo which you are now viewing is hosted at Github.</p>
